# MPI-Quicksort-Mergesort
This project contains C files to generate huge arrays and then sort them using quicksort and mergesort.
There are seperate code files to sort the arrays of sizes 2^11,2^13,2^15 and 2^17 and store them in files. 
The parallel implementation is done using MPI commands. This code is meant to be run on master slave cluster using mpicc and mpiexec commands.
Some output screenshots are also attached. Also for analysis, GFlops are also calculated to determine the performance on clusters and machines.
